- 👋 Hi, I’m @VancomycinHCl
- 👀 I’m interested in nothing, for I am a boring person.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning EE, and try to get my bachelor degree...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well, that is an intersting thing, you might utilize the things your human call it as 'rocket', for the major reason that I lives on the moon. 
- P.S.: Thanks to the over-space 4G signal between moon and earth, I can get to know github and leave the message.
